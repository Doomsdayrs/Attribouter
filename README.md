Attribouter is a lightweight "about screen" for Android apps, built to allow developers to easily give credit to a project's contributors and open source libraries, while matching the style of their app and saving the largest amount of time and effort possible.

For demonstration and experimentation, an apk of the sample project can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/TheAndroidMaster/Attribouter/releases/).

## Usage

### Setup

The Gradle dependency will soon be available through jCenter, which is used by default in Android Studio. Until then, simply add the following to your project's build.gradle file instead:
```gradle
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/18jafenn90/maven' }
  }
}
```

To add the dependency to your project, copy this line into the dependencies section of your build.gradle file.
 
```gradle
compile 'me.jfenn:attribouter:0.0.1'
```

#### Starting an Activity
This is pretty simple.

``` java
Attribouter.from(context).show();
```

#### Creating a Fragment
This is also pretty simple.

``` java
Fragment fragment = Attribouter.from(context).toFragment();
```

### Request Limits

This library does not use an auth key for the GitHub API by default. It does cache data for up to 10 days to avoid crossing GitHub's [rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/), but if your project has more than 10 contributors or libraries *or* you want it to have access to a private repository, you will need to provide an auth token by calling `.withGitHubToken(token)` on your instance of `Attribouter`.

### Configuration
By default, Attribouter will use the configuration file at [res/xml/attribouter.xml](https://github.com/TheAndroidMaster/Attribouter/blob/master/attribouter/src/main/res/xml/attribouter.xml). You can either name your configuration file "attribouter.xml" to override the resource, or name it differently and call `.withFile(R.xml.[name])` on your instance of `Attribouter` instead.

The configuration file consists of a single root element, `<about>`, with several possible child elements that can be added any amount of times in any order. You can either make one by looking at the [configuration file](https://github.com/TheAndroidMaster/Attribouter/blob/master/app/src/main/res/xml/about.xml) of the sample app for an example, or by using the list below.

#### `<appInfo>`
Displays the app icon, name, version, and links to the project on github and its website if available.

|Attribute|Type|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|repo|String (name/repository)|The github repository to fetch data from.|
|icon|String (URL) / Drawable Resource|The app icon to display.|
|description|String / String Resource|A short description of the app/project.|
|playStoreUrl|String / String Resource (URL)|The URL of the app on the Play Store (generated from the package name by default).|
|showPlayStoreUrl|Boolean|Whether to display the "rate" button (defaults to true).|
|websiteUrl|String / String Resource (URL)| The website of the project.|
|gitHubUrl|String / String Resource (URL)|The URL for the open source GitHub project. You do not need to define this if it is the same as `repo`.|

#### `<text>`
A block of text.

|Attribute|Type|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|text|String / String Resource (HTML)|A string or string resource, can be formatted in html (links work too) that defines the text to display.|
|centered|Boolean|Whether the text should be centered.|

#### `<contributors>`
Shows a list of the contributors of a project on github, merged with a list of child `<contributor>` elements defined in the configuration file. For example, if a user with the login "TheAndroidMaster" is both in GitHub and the configuration file, its attributes will be merged so that any attributes beginning with a "^" character will override the information from GitHub, and any attributes not beginning with a "^" character will be used while the GitHub information is loading, or if the information from GitHub is not present or unavailable.

##### `<contributor>`

|Attribute|Type|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|repo|String (name/repository)|The GitHub repository to fetch contributors from.|
|login|String|The GitHub username/login of the contributor (especially useful for overriding specific attributes of certian contributors.|
|name|String / String Resource|The name of the contributor.|
|avatar|String (URL) / Drawable Resource|The "profile picture" of the contributor.|
|task|String / String Resource|A short phrase describing the contributor's role in the project ("Icon Designer", "Founder", etc).|
|bio|String / String Resource|The biography of the contributor.|
|blog|String / String Resource (URL)|The contributor's website.|
|email|String / String Resource|The email of the contributor.|
|position|Integer|If this attribute is given to three contributors with values between 1 and 3 (one each), they will be displayed in a row at the top of the list (1 in the middle, slightly bigger, 2 on the left, 3 on the right).|

#### `<licenses>`
A list of the open source licenses used by the project. Child elements are `<project>` tags with attributes that function similar to the `<contributor>`s ("^" overrides GitHub values, otherwise they're replaced by the GitHub data), except the repository is defined by a `repo` attribute (starting a value with "^" is obsolete if the `repo` attribute is not defined).

##### `<license>`

|Attribute|Type|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|repo|String (name/repository)|The GitHub repository to fetch the license's information from.|
|title|String / String Resource|The name of the project (will be generated from the repository name if not present, ex: "TheAndroidMaster/ColorPickerDialog" -> "Color Picker Dialog").|
|description|String / String Resource|A description of what the project contains.|
|website|String / String Resource|A URL of the website for the project.|
|license|String|The "key" of the license the project is under. This will cause Attribouter to fetch information from the [GitHub Licenses API](https://developer.github.com/v3/licenses/).|
|licenseName|String / String Resource|The name of the license.|
|licenseBody|String / String Resource|The content of the license.|
|licenseUrl|String / String Resource|The URL of the license.|

### Things You Can Override

Couple strings, drawables, themes, etc. If you make any translations, feel free to make a PR because I like PRs. PRs are nice.
