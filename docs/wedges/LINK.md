Link tags can exist inside of the `<appInfo>`, `<contributor>`, or `<project>` tags. A few links are generated by default, such as links to the github profile of contributors for which the `login` attribute has been specified, and so on. App info links are displayed below the app description, contributor links are displayed in a dialog (that only appears if the contributor has a `bio`), and project links are displayed below the project description. See [issue #12](https://github.com/TheAndroidMaster/Attribouter/issues/12) for more information about this tag.

|url|String|The url of the link.|

|priority|Integer|Defines how the links should be sorted - the highest priority appears first in the list, and/or is opened when the whole item is clicked.|
